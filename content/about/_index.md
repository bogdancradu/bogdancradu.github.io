## About Me

I'm a software developer with a strong cybersecurity foundation and a long-running habit of turning curiosity into working systems. Before moving into development, I spent a couple of years as an on-premise network administrator, where I learned how real infrastructure behaves outside of textbooks, under load, under pressure, and under change.

During college, I transitioned fully into software development and stayed close to security as a hobby. I was an active CTF player for two years, which sharpened the way I think: break problems down, follow evidence, understand systems deeply, and never assume something is secure just because "it works".

I'm passionate about learning and exploring new technologies, especially when they help automate the boring parts of life. If something can be automated, from smart homes to software workflows, I'll probably try to automate it. Lately, my focus has shifted heavily toward AI: what it can do today, how it can be made better, and where it genuinely belongs in real products and systems.

At the core, I enjoy building practical solutions, understanding how things fail, and continuously leveling up one experiment at a time.
